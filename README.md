# automatic-image-captioning
This is the second project of my Computer Vision Nanodegree course.

In this project we combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) techniques to build a deep learning model,trained on Microsoft's Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset that produces captions given an input image.

Image captioning requires us to create a complex deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input image into a set of features, and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive language.
